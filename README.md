# Canvas-Gradescope-Late-Submission


Gradescope is intergraded within Canvas, but it won't pass back the submission time to the Canvas. 

For instructors who would like to use Canvas Late Policy for Gradescope submissions, this project has demoed an automated way to script the late submission time from Gradescope course, then upload the late submission time to the Canvas on the behalf of the student.
